Oil sands is an accurate term because bitumen, a heavy petroleum product is mixed with the sand.

      "|  Accelerated capital cost allowance (CCA)    |                    CCA is essentially a yearly deduction allowed by Revenue Canada (CRA) to expense a portion of an asset. For example if you a purchase a computer you are not allowed to expense it all in one year since the computer will likely last at least 3 years or longer. A useful life is assigned to an asset and an annual rate at which they should be expensed is applied. An accelerated CCA allows the company to shorten the number of years of an assets useful life, enabling them to claim the capital cost in a shorter period of time.                      |                                         |\n",

API gravity can be used to calculate how many barrels of crude oil can be produced per metric ton. Given that the weight of an oil plays an integral role in establishing its market value, API is an important measure.                                                   |                                         |\n",

Natural gas in a liquid state is called Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). The process is completed using a cooling process. The natural gas is super-cooled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius), converting it to LNG. In liquid form, natural gas takes up to 600 times less space than in its gaseous state, making it feasible and more economical for transport over long distances.                                               |                                         |\n",

When natural gas is shipped to a distant foreign market outside of where it is produced, the natural gas needs to ‘shrink in size’ or be compressed in order to ship large volumes economically – this liquefies the natural gas (LNG). The ‘shrinking’ of natural gas reduces its volume by a factor of about 600.                                   |                                         |\n",

      "|           Oil Sands or Tar Sands             | The hydrocarbon mixtures found in northern Alberta have historically been referred to as tar, pitch or asphalt. However, ‘oil sands’ is now used most often to describe the naturally occurring bitumen deposits. This helps distinguish it from the other terms, which are associated with distilled or man-made products, such as the mixtures used to pave roads. Oil sands is an accurate term because bitumen, a heavy petroleum product is mixed with the sand. It makes sense to describe the resource as oil sands because oil is what is finally derived from the bitumen.” |                                         |\n",

Canadian tax law allows the company to deduct part of an assets cost (for example, equipment) from its pre-tax cash flow every year. Assets are considered an expense because they require money to operate and will eventually require replacement. Claiming the cost of using assets each year as an expense reduces the amount of taxable income reported.                                    |                                         |\n",
